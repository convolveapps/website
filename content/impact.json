    "predictive-maintenance": "<p>Equipment plays the heart of every manufacturing unit to carry out daily operations. Any interruptions caused even by a tiny disturbance might bring down the whole plant to a shutdown. Data shows unplanned losses caused by equipment downtime contributes to a whopping 30% of the total downtime contributing to a major chunk of production loss. Experience our equipment reliability framework  delivered to our clients for the reliability of equipment across blast furnaces, steel melt shops, gas lines, rotating equipment, drilling etc. for studying the behavioral aspects of any slow/critical machines and forecasting its failures beforehand. Such a system is prescriptive and extends a guided solution to the operator for preventing an upcoming unwanted event.</p>",
    "optimization-based-scheduling": "<p>Scheduling is one of the fundamental aspects of any industry to streamline their operation with planned actions. Without proper scheduling manufacturing industries will under produce or over produce which leads to unanticipated losses. Using this framework industries will meet their production goals with efficient procurement and resource management.The components of the framework are flexible in nature and can be modulated depending on the problem domain.</p>",
    "process-control": "<p>Manual process controls are experience driven which includes individual bias and are prone to inconsistent outcome. Classical control approaches require the knowledge of underlying system behaviour.</p> <p>Contrary to this , AI-based controls are data-driven that includes operator’s experience and that are not baised. includes knowledge of experience excluding operator bias. The framework is intelligent & generic, doesn’t require system designers to model every detail of their processes. Our framework is cost efficient and improves the overall performance by giving a closed loop system control.</p>",
    "pricing-analytics": "<p>Small- and Large-scale companies often miss out on potential customers or suffer huge losses at the end of a financial year mostly due to the wrong decisions taken while setting their product prices. Statistics show that a company’s profitability could increase up to 200% if management sets optimized price points against each product.</p> <p>To enable stakeholders, to make the right decisions, we leverage historical pricing information coupled up with advanced predictive analytics to build an optimized and dynamic pricing system. Our capabilities range from validating the elasticity of a product to forecasting its demand. A robust pricing system gives every organization an edge over its competitors."
